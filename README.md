#Project By Proud Ding#
Hello，Gina~This is Proud
All project items are in the “Proud-AllPart1-4.py”
Due to the language barrier, I don't know if I understand the requirements of the question. 
If I make a mistake or miss some items, I hope you can tell me, and I will correct it in time. 
I hope I can get full marks through hard work.

I have uploaded all my completed projects and homework. Below are the urls of my other projects：
